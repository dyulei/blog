BROWSERS AND AUTHORING TOOLS 浏览器及开发工具
=========================

The web's usefulness and growth depends on its universality. We should be able to publish regardless of the software we use, the computer we have, the language we speak, whether we are wired or wireless, regardless of our sensory or interaction modes. We should be able to access the web from any kind of hardware that can connect to the Internet – stationary or mobile, small or large. W3C facilitates this listening and blending via international web standards. These standards ensure that all the crazy brilliance continues to improve a web that is open to us all.

网站的实用性和发展依赖于其普遍性。我们应该能够发布不依赖于软件、硬件、语言、网络类型及感觉或交互方式的网站，而且应该能够从任何设备（移动或固定，不论大小）访问它。W3C 致力于通过国际化的 Web 标准来保障和促进所有充满创意的网站不断进步。
