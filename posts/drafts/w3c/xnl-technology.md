XML TECHNOLOGY XML 技术
============

XML Technologies including XML, XML Namespaces, XML Schema, XSLT, Efficient XML Interchange (EXI), and other related standards.

XML 技术包括：XML、XML 命名空间、XML 语法、XSLT、高效 XML 交换（EXI）以及其他相关标准。

XML Essentials XML 基础
--------------

XML is shouldered by a set of essential technologies such as the infoset and namespaces. They address issues when using XML in specific applications contexts.

Schema 语法
------

Formal descriptions of vocabularies create flexibility in authoring environments and quality control chains. W3C’s XML Schema, SML, and data binding technologies provide the tools for quality control of XML data.

Security 安全性
--------

Manipulating data with XML requires sometimes integrity, authentication and privacy. XML signature, encryption, and xkms can help create a secure environment for XML.

Transformation 转换
--------------

Very frequently one wants to transform XML content into other formats (including other XML formats). XSLT and XPath are very powerful tools for creating different representations of XML content.

Query 检索
-----

XQuery (supported by XPath) is a query language for XML to extract data, similar to the role of SQL for databases, or SPARQL for the Semantic Web.

Components 组件
----------

The XML ecosystem is using additional tools to create a richer environment for using and manipulating XML documents. These components include style sheets, xlink xml:id, xinclude, xpointer, xforms, xml fragments, and events.

Processing 处理
----------

A processing model defines what operations should be performed in what order on an XML document.

Internationalization 国际化
--------------------

W3C has worked with the community on the internationalization of XML, for instance for specifying the language of XML content.

Publishing 发布
----------

XML grew out of the technical publication community. Use XSL-FO to publish even large or complex multilingual XML documents to HTML, PDF or other formats; include SVG diagrams and MathML formulas in the output.
