WEB ARCHITECTURE Web 架构
==============

Web Architecture focuses on the foundation technologies and principles which sustain the Web, including URIs and HTTP.

Web 架构以支撑 Web 的基础技术和原理为核心，包括：URIs 和 HTTP。

Architecture Principles 架构原则
-----------------------

Web Architecture principles help to design technologies by providing guidance and articulating the issues around some specific choices.

Identifiers 标识符
-----------

We share things by their names. URL, URI, IRI is the way to name things on the Web and manipulate them. Some additional addressing needs in the Web Services stack motivated some additional layers.

Protocols 协议
---------

Protocols are the vehicle for exchanging our ideas. HTTP is the core protocol of the Web. W3C is also working on XML Protocols and SOAP in relation to Web Services.

Meta Formats 元数据格式
------------

XML, the Extensible Markup Language, is used to build new formats at low cost (due to widely available tools to manipulate content in those new formats). RDF and OWL allow people to define vocabularies (“ontologies”) of terms as part of the Semantic Web.

Protocol and Meta Format Considerations 协议及元数据格式的注意事项
---------------------------------------

Documents on the Web are loosely joined pieces by identifiers. It creates a maze of rich interactions between protocols and formats.

Internationalization 国际化
--------------------

W3C has worked with the community on the internationalization of identifiers (IRIs) and a general character model for the Web.
