WEB OF DEVICES 设备支持
=============

W3C is focusing on technologies to enable Web access anywhere, anytime, using any device. This includes Web access from mobile phones and other mobile devices as well as use of Web technology in consumer electronics, printers, interactive television, and even automobiles.

W3C 致力于使 Web 在任何地点、时间及设备上访问的技术。支持包括手机等移动设备，以及使用 Web 技术的电子产品、打印机、互动电视，甚至是汽车。

Mobile Web 移动设备上的 Web
----------

W3C promotes “One Web” that is available on any device. W3C’s Mobile Web Initiative helps ensure the best user experience on mobile devices, taking into account device capabilities, location, and other context information.

Voice Browsing 语音浏览
--------------

The W3C Speech Interface Framework is a suite of specifications (e.g. VoiceXML) integrating Web technology and speech interaction. VoiceXML, PLS, SISR, SRGS, SCXML, and CCXML all contribute to the Speech Interface Framework.

Device Independence and Content Adaptation 设备独立和内容自适应
------------------------------------------

Devices come in many shapes, capabilities and sizes which define constraints on the content these devices can handle. Device descriptions, content transformation guidelines, device APIs and CC/PP help developers to optimize the user experience.

Multimodal Access 多方式访问
-----------------

Increasingly, interactions with devices doesn’t only happen with a keyboard, but also through voice, touch and gestures. The W3C Multimodal architecture and its components (EMMA, InkML) allow developers to adapt applications to new interaction modes.

Web and TV 互联网和电视
----------

With the advent of IP-based devices, connected TVs are progressing at a fast pace and traditional TV broadcasting is quickly evolving into a more immersive experience where users can interact with rich applications that are at least partly based on Web technologies. There is strong growth in the deployment of devices that integrate regular Web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and SVG, coupled with various device APIs.
