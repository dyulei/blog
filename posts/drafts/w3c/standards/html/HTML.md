###Standards 标准


####RDFa Core 1.1[2012-06-07] RDFa 核心 1.1

RDFa Core is a specification for attributes to express structured data in any markup language. The embedded data already available in the markup language (e.g., XHTML) is reused by the RDFa markup, so that publishers don't need to repeat significant data in the document content.

####XHTML+RDFa 1.1[2012-06-07]

RDFa Core 1.1 defines attributes and syntax for embedding semantic markup in Host Languages. This document defines one such Host Language. This language is a superset of XHTML 1.1, integrating the attributes as defined in RDFa Core 1.1.

####RDFa Lite 1.1[2012-06-07]

RDFa Lite is a small subset of RDFa consisting of a few attributes that may be applied to most simple to moderate structured data markup tasks. While it is not a complete solution for advanced markup tasks, it does provide a good entry point for beginners.

####XHTML™ Basic 1.1 - Second Edition[2010-11-23] XHTML Basic 1.1 - 第二版

The XHTML Basic document type includes the minimal set of modules required to be an XHTML host language document type, and in addition it includes images, forms, basic tables, and object support. It is designed for Web clients that do not support the full set of XHTML features; for example, Web clients such as mobile phones, PDAs, pagers, and settop boxes. The document type is rich enough for content authoring.

XHTML Basic is designed as a common base that may be extended. The goal of XHTML Basic is to serve as a common language supported by various kinds of user agents.

This revision, 1.1, supercedes version 1.0 as defined in http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xhtml-basic-20001219. In this revision, several new features have been incorporated into the language in order to better serve the small-device community that is this language's major user:

+ XHTML Forms (defined in [XHTMLMOD])
+ Intrinsic Events (defined in [XHTMLMOD])
+ The value attribute for the li element (defined in [XHTMLMOD])
+ The target attribute (defined in [XHTMLMOD])
+ The style element (defined in [XHTMLMOD])
+ The style attribute (defined in [XHTMLMOD])
+ XHTML Presentation module (defined in [XHTMLMOD])
+ The inputmode attribute (defined in Section 5 of this document)
+ The document type definition is implemented using XHTML modules as defined in " XHTML Modularization" [XHTMLMOD].

####XHTML™ 1.1 - Module-based XHTML - Second Edition[2010-11-23] XHTML 1.1 - 基于模块的 XHTMLl - 第二版

XHTML 1.1 redefines XHTML 1.0 based on a modular design, with support for Ruby Annotation. This new edition corrects various bugs and introduces XML Schema modules.

####XHTML-Print - Second Edition[2010-11-23] XHTML 打印 - 第二版

XHTML-Print is member of the family of XHTML languages defined by the Modularization of XHTML [XHTMLMOD]. It is designed to be appropriate for printing from mobile devices to low-cost printers that might not have a full-page buffer and that generally print from top-to-bottom and left-to-right with the paper in a portrait orientation. XHTML-Print is also targeted at printing in environments where it is not feasible or desirable to install a printer-specific driver and where some variability in the formatting of the output is acceptable.

####RDFa in XHTML: Syntax and Processing[2008-10-14] XHTML 中的 RDFa：语法和执行

####Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 HTML Specification[2003-01-09] DOM2 HTML 规范

####XHTML™ 1.0 The Extensible HyperText Markup Language (Second Edition)[2002-08-01] XHTML 1.0 可扩展超文本标记语言（第二版）

This specification defines the Second Edition of XHTML 1.0, a reformulation of HTML 4 as an XML 1.0 application, and three DTDs corresponding to the ones defined by HTML 4. The semantics of the elements and their attributes are defined in the W3C Recommendation for HTML 4. These semantics provide the foundation for future extensibility of XHTML. Compatibility with existing HTML user agents is possible by following a small set of guidelines.

####Ruby Annotation[2001-05-31] Ruby 注释

"Ruby" are short runs of text alongside the base text, typically used in East Asian documents to indicate pronunciation or to provide a short annotation. This document proposes a set of CSS properties associated with the 'Ruby' elements. They can be used in combination with the Ruby elements of HTML.

####HTML 4.01 Specification[1999-12-24] HTML 4.01 规范

This specification defines the HyperText Markup Language (HTML), the publishing language of the World Wide Web. This specification defines HTML 4.01, which is a subversion of HTML 4. In addition to the text, multimedia, and hyperlink features of the previous versions of HTML (HTML 3.2 [HTML32] and HTML 2.0 [RFC1866]), HTML 4 supports more multimedia options, scripting languages, style sheets, better printing facilities, and documents that are more accessible to users with disabilities. HTML 4 also takes great strides towards the internationalization of documents, with the goal of making the Web truly World Wide.

HTML 4 is an SGML application conforming to International Standard ISO 8879 -- Standard Generalized Markup Language [ISO8879].

####HTML 3.2 Reference Specification[1997-01-14] HTML 3.2 参考规范

###Group Notes 小组记录

####HTML: The Markup Language (an HTML language reference)[2013-05-28] HTML：标记语言（HTML 语言参考）

This document describes the HTML markup language and provides details to help producers of HTML content create documents that conform to the language. It is not the normative specification but intended for authors.

####HTML5: Edition for Web Authors[2013-05-28] HTML5：Web 开发者版

This document is a strict subset of the HTML5 specification that omits user-agent (UA) implementation details. It is targeted toward Web authors and others who are not UA implementors and who want a view of the HTML specification that focuses more precisely on details relevant to using the HTML language to create Web documents and Web applications.

####main element - an HTML5 extension specification[2013-05-28] 主要元素 - HTML5 扩展规范

This specification is an extension to the HTML5 specification. It defines an element to be used for the identification of the main content area of a document. The main element formalises the common practice of identification of the main content section of a document using the id values such as 'content' and 'main'. It also defines an HTML element that embodies the semantics and function of the WAI-ARIA landmark role=main.

####Microdata to RDF[2012-10-09	] RDF 微数据

HTML microdata [MICRODATA] is an extension to HTML used to embed machine-readable data into HTML documents. Whereas the microdata specification describes a means of markup, the output format is JSON. This specification describes processing rules that may be used to extract RDF [RDF-CONCEPTS] from an HTML document containing microdata.

####RDFa API[2012-07-05]

RDFa [RDFA-CORE] enables authors to publish structured information that is both human- and machine-readable. Concepts that have traditionally been difficult for machines to detect, like people, places, events, music, movies, and recipes, are now easily marked up in Web documents. While publishing this data is vital to the growth of Linked Data, using the information to improve the collective utility of the Web for humankind is the true goal. To accomplish this goal, it must be simple for Web developers to extract and utilize structured information from a Web document. This document details such a mechanism; an RDFa Application Programming Interface (RDFa API) that allows simple extraction and usage of structured information from a Web document.

####RDFa 1.1 Primer[2012-06-07] RDFa 1.1 入门

HTML and RDFa (Resource Description Framework in Attributes) provides a set of markup attributes to augment visual information on the Web with machine-readable hints. In this Primer, we show how to express data using RDFa in HTML, and in particular how to mark up existing human-readable Web page content to express machine-readable data.

####HTML Data Guide[2012-03-08] HTML 数据指导

This guide aims to help publishers and consumers of HTML data use it well. With several syntaxes and vocabularies to choose from, it provides guidance about how to decide which meets the publisher's or consumer's needs. It discusses when it is necessary to mix syntaxes and vocabularies and how to publish and consume data that uses multiple formats. It describes how to create vocabularies that can be used in multiple syntaxes and general best practices about the publication and consumption of HTML data.

####HTML/XML Task Force Report[2012-02-09] HTML/XML 工作组报告

####HLink[2010-12-16]

The HLink module defined in this specification provides XHTML Family Members with the ability to specify which attributes of elements represent Hyperlinks, and how those hyperlinks should be traversed, and extends XLink use to a wider class of languages than those restricted to the syntactic style allowed by XLink.

####XFrames[2010-12-16]

XFrames is an XML application for composing documents together, replacing HTML Frames. By being a separate application from XHTML, it allows content negotiation to determine if the user agent accepts frames; by encoding the 'population' of frames in the URI, it allows framesets to be bookmarked.

####XHTML Role Attribute Module[2010-12-16] XHTML 角色属性模块

The XHTML Role Attribute defined in this specification allows the author to annotate XML Languages with machine-extractable semantic information about the purpose of an element. Use cases include accessibility, device adaptation, server-side processing, and complex data description. This attribute can be integrated into any markup language based upon XHTML Modularization [XHTMLMOD].

####XHTML Access Module[2010-12-16] XHTML 可访问性模块

The XHTML Access module defines an element that, when used in conjunction with other XHTML modules in XHTML Family Markup Languages, enables a more robust accessibility model than is presently possible.
