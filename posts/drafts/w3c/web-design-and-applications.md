WEB DESIGN AND APPLICATIONS Web 设计及应用
========================

Web Design and Applications involve the standards for building and Rendering Web pages, including HTML, CSS, SVG, device APIs, and other technologies for Web Applications (“WebApps”). This section also includes information on how to make pages accessible to people with disabilities (WCAG), to internationalize them, and make them work on mobile devices.

Web 设计及应用包含了网页构建和渲染相关的标准，包括：HTML、CSS、SVG、设备 API 及其他 Web 应用（WebApps）相关的技术。本节也包含了网页可访问性、国际化及移动设备支持等内容。

HTML & CSS
----------

HTML and CSS are the fundamental technologies for building Web pages: HTML (html and xhtml) for structure, CSS for style and layout, including WebFonts. Find resources for good Web page design as well as helpful tools.

HTML 和 CSS 是建立网页的基础技术：HTML（包括 html 和 xhtml）用于网站结构，CSS 用于样式和布局，还包括 Web 字体。你可以在这里找到有利于网页设计的资源和工具。

JavaScript Web APIs
-------------------

Standard APIs for client-side Web Application development include those for Geolocation, XMLHttpRequest, and mobile widgets. W3C standards for document models (the “DOM”) and technologies such as XBL allow content providers to create interactive documents through scripting.

与客户端 Web 应用开发相关的标准包括：地理定位、XMLHttpRequest 及移动设备组件。W3C 的文档模型（“DOM”）和 XBL 等技术标准使内容提供者可以通过脚本创建交互式的文档。

Graphics 图像
--------

W3C is the home of the widely deployed PNG raster format, SVG vector format, and the Canvas API. WebCGM is a more specialized format used, for example, in the fields of automotive engineering, aeronautics.

W3C 是 PNG 光栅格式、SVG 矢量格式及 Canvas API 的发源地。WebCGM 是更加专业的格式，被应用于汽车工程及航空等领域。

Audio and Video 音视频
---------------

Some of the W3C formats that enable authoring audio and video presentations include HTML, SVG, and SMIL (for synchronization). W3C is also working on a timed text format for captioning and other applications.

W3C 的某些格式使音视频作者能够在 HTML、SVG 及 SMIL（同步地）中展示其作品。W3C 也在为字幕和其他应用开发一种同步文本格式。

Accessibility 可访问性
-------------

W3C’s Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) has published Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to help authors create content that is accessible to people with disabilities. WAI-ARIA gives authors more tools to create accessible Web Applications by providing additional semantics about widgets and behaviors.



Internationalization
--------------------

W3C has a mission to design technology that works across cultures and languages. W3C standards such as HTML and XML are built on Unicode, for instance. In addition, W3C has published guidance for authors related to language tags bi-directional (bidi) text, and more.

Mobile Web
----------

W3C promotes “One Web” that is available on any device. W3C’s Mobile Web Best Practices help authors understand how to create content that provides a reasonable experience on a wide variety of devices, contexts, and locations.

Privacy
-------

The Web is a powerful tool for communications and transactions of all sorts. It is important to consider privacy and security implications of the Web as part of technology design. Learn more about tracking and Web App security.

Math on the Web
---------------

Mathematics and formula are used on the Web for business reports, education materials and scientific research. W3C’s MathML enables mathematics to be served, received, and processed on the World Wide Web, just as HTML has enabled this functionality for other types of content.
