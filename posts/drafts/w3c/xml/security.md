What is XML Signature?

The XML Signature specification defines digital signature processing rules and syntax. XML Signatures provide integrity, message authentication, and/or signer authentication services for data of any type, whether located within the XML that includes the signature or elsewhere.

What is XML Encryption?

XML Encryption specifies a process for encrypting data and representing the result in XML. The data may be arbitrary data (including an XML document), an XML element, or XML element content. The result of encrypting data is an XML Encryption element which contains or references the cipher data.

What is XKMS?

The XKMS standard specifies protocols for distributing and registering public keys, suitable for use with the XML Signature and XML Encryption standards.
