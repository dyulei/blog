What is XQuery?

XQuery is a standardized language for combining documents, databases, Web pages and almost anything else. It is very widely implemented. It is powerful and easy to learn.

What is XQuery Used For?

XQuery is replacing proprietary middleware languages and Web Application development languages. XQuery is replacing complex Java or C++ programs with a few lines of code. XQuery is simpler to work with and easier to maintain than many other alternatives.

It is used as a back end for implementing Web sites, integrating corporate data stores in the enterprise, in the XRX architecture (XForms, REST and XQuery), as well as for large publishing projects, for data mining, and for academic research. It can run on large servers and on mobile devices, as part of commercial software and as open source.
